# Base

Base is a series of iterative games, focused solely as a personal
challenge. The titles are based on the Greek alphabet, and are found on separate
branches in this repository. For the time being, there are no
characters/movement as such, it is a strategy game, putting you at the helm of
mission control at your own space centre. Feel free to suggest ideas/contribute
to the project. Enjoy!
